# 🌟 My 42 Journey

Welcome to the repository summarizing my entire journey through **École 42** — a transformative experience that taught me not only how to code, but how to **learn, think, and build** like a true software engineer.  
Every project pushed me further — technically, logically, and personally. This file is a reflection of what I learned and achieved through the 42 curriculum.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **42 curriculum** is a project-based, peer-learning program with no teachers and no predefined courses.  
You learn by solving problems, reading documentation, debugging for hours, and collaborating with other students — the essence of becoming autonomous.

## 🧱 C Language Foundations

### 🧩 `libft`
> My very first 42 project.  
I reimplemented essential C standard library functions from scratch, learning memory management, pointers, and code organization.  
**Skills gained:** Low-level programming, modular design, Makefile mastery.

---

### 🖨️ `ft_printf`
> A recreation of the C `printf()` function.  
This project strengthened my understanding of **variadic functions**, **format parsing**, and **buffer management**.  
**Skills gained:** Parsing logic, formatted output, advanced memory control.

---

### 📄 `get_next_line`
> Implemented a function to read files line by line efficiently.  
I learned how to manage buffers, static variables, and edge cases in file reading.  
**Skills gained:** File I/O, static memory handling, algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🖥️ System & Administration

### 🛡️ `Born2beRoot`
> My first real dive into **system administration**.  
I built a secure Debian-based virtual machine following strict rules for users, permissions, partitions, and services.  
**Skills gained:** Linux administration, SSH, UFW, systemd, password policy, virtualization.

---

## 🔁 Algorithms & Data Structures

### 🔢 `Push_swap`
> A sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks and a restricted set of operations.  
I designed an efficient algorithm to sort data under constraints, with a focus on optimization and time complexity.  
**Skills gained:** Algorithm design, complexity analysis, data structures.

---

### 🕹️ `So_long`
> My first **2D game** using the MiniLibX graphics library.  
I learned about event loops, rendering, collision handling, and game logic.  
**Skills gained:** Graphics programming, event-driven logic, map parsing.

---

### 🔗 `Pipex`
> Recreated shell pipelines like `< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`.  
I discovered process creation, redirections, and inter-process communication through pipes.  
**Skills gained:** Forking, piping, file descriptors, process management.

---

### 💬 `Minishell`
> My own miniature shell inspired by Bash.  
It supported command parsing, environment variables, redirections, and pipes.  
**Skills gained:** Parsing, process control, signal handling, terminal behavior, and teamwork.

---

## 🧠 Multithreading & Synchronization

### 🧘 `Philosophers`
> The classic **dining philosophers** concurrency problem.  
I learned how to handle threads, mutexes, and timing precisely to avoid deadlocks and race conditions.  
**Skills gained:** Threads, mutex synchronization, real-time debugging, concurrency.

---

## 🧭 Advanced Projects

### 🧱 `Cub3D`
> A **3D raycasting engine** inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.  
This was my first step into computer graphics and game engines.  
**Skills gained:** Math for graphics, raycasting, texture mapping, user input, frame rendering.

---

### 🌐 `NetPractice`
> A hands-on networking simulation.  
I configured virtual networks, routing tables, and subnet masks to understand IP addressing deeply.  
**Skills gained:** Networking fundamentals, IP routing, subnetting.

---

## 💡 C++ Piscine (Modules 00 → 09)

> Transitioning from C to C++ was a major step.  
Each module introduced **object-oriented programming** concepts, from classes and inheritance to templates and STL containers.  
**Skills gained:** OOP, encapsulation, polymorphism, templates, exceptions, design patterns, clean architecture.

---

## 🌍 Web & Systems

### 🌐 `Webserv`
> A full HTTP/1.1 web server built from scratch in C++.  
It handles requests, responses, CGI, chunked transfer, and multiple clients concurrently.  
**Skills gained:** Networking in C++, sockets, HTTP protocol, state machines, event-driven design.

---

### 🐳 `Inception`
> Built a complete infrastructure using **Docker**.  
I containerized NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB with persistent volumes and custom configurations.  
**Skills gained:** Docker, NGINX, databases, environment management, DevOps basics.

---

### 🕹️ `Transcendence`
> The **final project** — a full-stack web application.  
Built a real-time multiplayer **Pong** game with authentication, chat, and user profiles.  
**Skills gained:** TypeScript, NestJS, React, WebSockets, JWT, PostgreSQL, API design, team collaboration.

---

## 🧪 Exams

I completed all exams from **Rank 02 to Rank 06**, testing my ability to code under pressure without external resources.  
**Skills reinforced:** Problem solving, time management, and code efficiency.

---

## 🏁 What I Gained

- **Autonomy:** Learning how to learn, without tutorials or teachers.  
- **Resilience:** Debugging for hours, staying patient through failure.  
- **Collaboration:** Peer evaluations, teamwork, and communication.  
- **Technical depth:** From low-level C to high-level web development and DevOps.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Learned

**Languages:** C, C++, Python (basics), TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, Bash  
**Concepts:** Algorithms, OOP, System programming, Multithreading, Networking, WebSockets, Docker, Databases  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, NGINX, Linux, Make, Vim, Valgrind, GDB, Firebase  

---

## 🎓 Conclusion

The 42 curriculum is not just about coding — it’s about **building a mindset**.  
After completing all these projects, I’ve learned how to **understand any system, adapt, and solve complex problems independently**.  
It’s been a challenging but deeply rewarding experience that shaped me into a better developer and problem solver.
